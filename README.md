# tictactoe

Going to create a tictactoe game as part of the Odin Project course.

First going to focus on creating a barebones version that can be played through console.

Created the index.html, styles.css and script.js files.

Made the game playable through console, the game is working. Now need to implement the UI.

Completed the project, pushed to git.
